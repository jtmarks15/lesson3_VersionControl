            <p class="lead">
                There are three states in Git that files can be stored in: committed, modified, and stages. When the data is safely stored in your local database, it is committed. A file that has been changed but has not yet been committed to the database is modified. A marked modified file in its current version is staged and ready to go on to the next commit file. These states are stored in the Git directory, which is the most important part of the program because it stores the data and can be transferred from one computer to another. This information is relevant to the course because we are using Git to store our files for the websites we design. This is important so that the files will be keep in a secure environment as well as the access it allows for us to show future employers our experience in Web Development.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                What makes Git different from other versioning control systems is how Git saves the data. Other systems keep data as sets of files, whereas Git thinks about it in snapshots of a filesystem. For example, when working on a project and it is saved, a screenshot is taken of the updated version of the file and keeps it as a reference. If the files are not changed, the file is not stored again, it would revert back to the previously saved version. The snapshots are then saved in the order of modification on the file. This information is important and relevant to the course because it goes over the basics of how Git actually works. It is important to note this information because Git is different that other versioning control systems, and knowing how to work each indiviual system is important to get the program to work correctly.

            <p class="lead">
                Most of the time Git only needs local files to operate accordingly. This basically means that no information from other computers on the network are needed to perform the task at hand. Git takes the data directly from your local database so that the response time is a lot quicker. It is even possible to update and continue to work on projects when offline, unlike many other CVS. Keeping the data stored locally is very useful because it allows the files and information to be retrieved a lot faster. This information is relevant to this course because if our internet connection is down at home, we can still work on our projects and the updates will still be there when we get on campus for wifi the next day!

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">
                Git was founded in 2005. The founding of Git was based on Linux kernel, who in 2002 began using a proproetary DVCS, BitKeeper. This partnership of Linux kernel and BitKeeper was broken-up in 2005 and one of its features, free status, was taken away from the public. The creator of Linux decided to develop his own tool based off of BitKeeper that would have speed, simple design, support for non-linear development, ability to handle larger scale projects, and to be fully distributed. Git was a trial and error project that came about from some not so good events, but has developed into something very beneficial for the tech community, which is why this information is important to note about how programs came about.

            <p class="lead">
                Version control is like a tape recorder, it records and saves multiple versions over time, even after it's been edited multiple times. Version control more specifically refers to a system that records changes to a file or set over time so that earlier versions can be pulled up at a later date if needed. This technology is especially useful in this class since we are writing code for web sites. If there is something wrong with an adjustment made to a certain part of the code, we can just revert back to an old version to see what it looked like at a certain point when it still worked. It also is useful to more easily recover files.
